                    BACKGROUND
                </div>
                    <p class="padding text-justify">India is a land poetically described as "Sujalam Sufalam" which depicts a land bountifully endowed with natural beauty and richness of resources. Indias north eastern region shares a major contribution to this glory with its equally diverse socio-cultural beauty. Surrounded by neighbour countries Bhutan, Chaina, Myanmar, and Bangladesh, the tiny frontier territories of North East India are connected to the rest of India through a land mass of around 70 kilometers at a place called Siliguri district in West Bengal.<br>
                    Snowâ€“capped mountain ranges, dense forests, natural caves and islands, beautiful lakes and mighty rivers like Bramhaputra make this place a veritable paradise. The insect eatingâ€“pitcher plant and one-horned rhinoceros are a specialty of the North East region. This picturesque and vibrant region of the country comprises of eight states “ Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and the latest inclusion of Sikkim.<br>
                    But due to Ignorance, lack of awareness, isolated geographical location, lack of political will it is lagging behind from the fast development which is being witnessed by almost all other parts of the country. This has led to no infrastructure development, absence of modern practice in agriculture, poor communication system, absence of advanced educational facilities, lack of entrepreneurial initiative, unemployment, and lack of conducive business environment triggered by continuous social unrest, poverty, worsened medical and public health facilities. Today the youth of North East India is struggling to prosper as the backbone of the society.<br>
                    The continuous deprivation brings out many youths and others out of north east every year in search of better educational facility, health and medical solutions, searching business avenues or finding entrepreneurial strides or many other objectives build on sheer positive will.<br>
                    India has been professing the idea of â€˜Vasudhaiva kutumbakam (The concept of global familyhood) since time immemorial. Today, as the whole world recognizes it as a guiding philosophy for international brotherhood & peace across the continents, we see a need to instill this eternal philosophy in the minds of every Indian.<br>
                    In their noble pursuit to strengthen the ropes of brotherhood between people from North East India and the rest of the country, Mr. B.K. Bawri and Mr. Sunil Deodhar initiated the concept of â€œHome away from Home. They later were joined by few like-minded people that resulted into the formation of My Home India in mid 2005. It's an NGO with a special focus to enrich the spirit of brotherhood with the people located in the distant corners of north eastern India.<br>
                    We at My Home India visualize a brighter India sans, the psychological barriers of cast, creed, community, province and other forces of division. Today with a presence in various cities and villages outside North East India, our volunteers are working to help the relocated NE students to meet their various needs in the field of education and health. My Home India also aims to make every Indian realize that these student too are children of same motherland.
