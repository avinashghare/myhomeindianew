                        <br>Addressing the audience Shri Kiren Rijiju said that the work of My Home India is great because it is trying to make the whole country recognize the identity of the North East as all discussion on development is meaningless without an identity. He expressed his concern over the indifference of the people in the rest ofIndiatowards the disasters in North East, including terrorist attacks and blasts while the people of North East are very sensitive and responsive to the happenings in the rest of the country. Exposing the myth of the unilateral withdrawal of the Chinese army in 1962 war, he told that the Chinese were forced to withdraw fromIndian territoryafter occupying it for a month because of the stiff resistance by the patriotic people of Arunachal Pradesh though the Indian leaders and the army had conceded the defeat.

                        <br>Deploring the negligence of the region he pointed to the fact that not even an inch of railway line was laid beyond Murkongsalek in the last sixty years after the British left the country though the Chinese have made tremendous development in the areas illegally occupied by them facilitating very fast movements of armies and their supplies. On Indian side the soldiers still have to trek for five / six days with their weapons and rucksacks. Terming Bangladeshi infiltrations a case of demographic aggression he called for prompt action before it is too late. Listening to him with the rapt attention the audience felt that his speech was revealing, inspiring and touching.
