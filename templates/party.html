                    <p>Arunachal is one of the most sparesely populated states of India, borders China, Bhutan and Myanmar. There are five major rivers â€“ Kameng, Subansiri, Siang (later the Brahmaputra in Assam), Lohit and Tirap and the mountain ranges follow the river systems. Home to a complex mix of communities, its people are friendly, colourful and simple. Its rich flora ranges from the Alpine to the subtropical, from rhododendrons to orchids. Its verdant forests, turbulent streams, lofty mountains and snow clad peaks make it a unique place. <br>
                    
                    There are 26 major tribes and a number of sub-tribes inhabiting this area.Broadly, the people have been divided into three cultural groups on the basis of their socio-religious backgrounds. The Monpas and Sherdukpens of Twang and West Kemeng districts follow the lamastic tradition of Mahayana Buddhism. Culturally similiar to them are the Membas and Khambas who live in the high mountains along the northern borders, Khamptis and Singphos inhabiting the eastern part of the State are Buddhists of Hinayana sect.  <br>
                    
                    They are said to have migrated from Thailand and Burma long ago.Another groups of people are the Adis, Akas, Apatanis, Bungnis, Nishis, Mishmis, Mijis, Thangsos etc. who worship the Sun and Moon God. Adis and Apatanis extensively practice wet-rice cultivation and have a considerable agricultural economy. Apatanis are also famous for their paddy-cum-fish culture. The third group comprises Noctes and Wanchos, adjoining Nagaland in the Tirap district.

                    <p><b>Assam, the mystic land of tea </b><br>
                    Guwahati is the majestic gateway city to the North-East and capital of the state of Assam. The magic land Assam is a verdant land of the eternal blue hills, a treasure of flora and fauna, a mystic land of tea, the home of one horned rhino, together with a numbers of fairs and festivals.  <br>
                    The word Assam is derived from the Sanskrit word â€œAsomâ€� meaning â€˜peerlessâ€™. The ancient history refers to Assam as Pragjyotishpur, until in 1228, the Ahoms from North Thailand invaded this land and established a kingdom, which came to be known as Assam. So here I was glad to know about the Thai connection with Irene smiling.<br>
                    The irresistible tourist attraction of Assam lies in her immense green stillness, the lush green forest, and the bewildering variety of wildlife.

                <p><b>How to Get there? </b><br>

                <p><b>Population </b><br>
                    Total Population of Assam is 26 million.
</p>

                <p><b>People and Culture</b><br>
                    PeopleThe society in Assam is not just a conglomeration of diverse racial and cultural elements but a composite whole arising out of the integration and synthesis of all of them. Indeed, Assam has been a curious melting pot into which have gone the Aryan and non-Aryan, the tribal and the non-tribal, the indigenous and the exotic, making for a delightful fare with wonderful mixed flavor. <br>
                    The majority of the population in the plains is made up of Hindus, speaking the Aryan Assamese language. But the Aryan racial strain is prominent only in the upper castes, most of the other other castes are of the Mongoloid stock.<br>
                    The Satras (seat of the religious head Satradhikar) and Namghars (house of names or Prayer hall) plays an important role in the life of an average Assamese and have acted as religious as well as cultural institutions.<br>
                    Majority of the tribal groups belong to the Tibeto-Burmese family. The colourful people of Assam consist of Bodo-Kacharis, Rabha & Hajongs, Tiwas (lalung), Misings, Sonowal Kacharis, Deuris, Karbis, Dimasa Kacharis, Rengma Naga, Zemi Naga, Kukis and the Hmars.<br>
                    In Assam, the line between the tribal and the non-tribal is pretty thin and the so-called non-tribal Assamese Hindu society retains many elements, which are patently â€˜tribalâ€™ by orthodox Hindu standards. Castes are not strictly occupation linked, and caste based disabilities are very few.<br>
                    More than 40 percent of Assamâ€™s population is thought to be of migrant origin. During the six hundred years of ruling, the Ahom Dynasty managed to keep the kingdom, independent from Mughal, the Muslim invaders of India before the British, as well as other invaders though Mughal attacked Assam seventeen times. During this era, the Assamese society was exogenous. The British entered Assam in 1824 as tea planters, which was the starting point of the destruction of Ahom Dynasty.<br>
                    The fairs and festivals in this sparsely populated state are essentially an opportunity for people from far and wide to converge and see the culture of the land.

The state is predominantly dominated by Naga communities and hence, it forms a single cultural region generally definable by common cultural and linguistic traditions. This state was carved out of the territories that were earlier known as Naga Hills â€“ Tuesnsang Area(NHTA), through the State of Nagaland Act, 1962. It was inaugurated on 1st December, 1963 by the then President of India, Dr S. Radhakrishnan.The state lies between 2506 deg and 2704 deg of the equator and between the longitudinal lines 93015 deg E.

<br> <br>                
 <b>Faith & Culture</b><br>
                    The entire Naga inhabited area may be described as one culture area, on account of several ethno-historical factors. There are 14 tribes in Nagaland. The traditional faith, religious beliefs and practices of Naga tribes show signs of being animistic. There is a belief of a supreme creator of mankind, and many deities, ghosts and spirits of trees, rivers and hills. There are priests and medicine-men who placate these spirits, banish those who give diseases, attract those who help and guard, and also take the lead in the rites and festivals, which stimulate the processes of agriculture. Among the Naga tribes (Chang, Sangtam, Khiamngan), there is a belief that the soul, after death, goes down a narrow path to the land of the dead that is guarded by a spirit with whom it must struggle. Most Naga tribes regard the ultimate ancestors of man and the tiger, as very intimately associated. The ancient Kachari capital, Dimapur is one of the important sites of megalithic culture. The ruins appear to be contemporaries with the Kachari civilisation, established before the Ahom invasion in the 13th century A.D. There are evidences of Hindu influence on most of them, though these are predominantly non-Aryan. Today 85% of the people are Christians.
